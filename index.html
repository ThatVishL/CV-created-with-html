    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I eat, sleep, and breathe hospitality. Ever since I remember, I have wanted to work in hospitality.
       My passion started growing up working in my parent's restaurant. I have strong social skills and a colloquial attitude towards my guests. 
       However, I can be authoritative as well, when the situation asks for it. After working many years in a management role in the vibrant nightlife of Norwich, I'm now looking forward to taking the next step in my career. My ambition is to work in a similar management role in the high-end hospitality industry.
